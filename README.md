# uPy-SL06
Generic Library to use with microbit-micropython and circuitpython.

* Use appropriate core library, uBit_core for microbit or cPy_core for CC03/CS11 devices.
* Due to limited microbit memory, only light/color and proximity sensing can be used.
* You can use all sensing with CC03/CS11 i.e. Light/color, proximity and gesture sensing.
